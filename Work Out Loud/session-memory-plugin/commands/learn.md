description: Capture standalone knowledge without a full session commit. Use when you've discovered something worth remembering — a gotcha, a mental model, a technique — and want to commit it directly. Faster and more focused than /remember.

# /learn [node] [type?] [content]

Quick-commit a single piece of knowledge to a project node.

---

## Usage patterns

```
/learn crm-dashboard gotcha The date picker silently truncates timezone info on save
/learn infra:aws model S3 event notifications have at-least-once delivery — design consumers to be idempotent
/learn learning:rust lesson Fighting the borrow checker usually means the data model is wrong — restructure ownership first
/learn client:acme recipe For their API: always send X-Tenant-Id header, even on public endpoints, or you get silent 403s
/learn domain:tax-law insight Section 179 deduction applies to software development costs if capitalized correctly
```

## Step 1 — Parse the input

Extract:
- **Node**: Which project node this belongs to (required)
- **Type**: One of: `insight`, `lesson`, `model`, `gotcha`, `recipe`, `correction` (optional — Claude will infer if omitted)
- **Content**: The knowledge to capture

If the user provides just natural language (e.g. `/learn that the API rate limit resets hourly not daily`), Claude should:
1. Infer the most relevant node from conversation context or ask
2. Infer the type from the content
3. Format appropriately

---

## Step 2 — Infer type if not specified

| If the content sounds like... | Assign type |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| "X works by..." / "The way X works is..." | MODEL |
| "Watch out for..." / "X silently does Y" / "Don't do X" | GOTCHA |
| "Tried X, it [worked/failed] because..." | LESSON |
| "I was wrong about X — actually it's Y" | CORRECTION |
| "For [situation], do [steps]" | RECIPE |
| General realization or connection | INSIGHT |

---

## Step 3 — Write to memory

Write a single knowledge entry:

```
[node-id] [TYPE] (YYYY-MM-DD): [content, compressed but precise]
```

Also check: does this new knowledge invalidate or reinforce any existing entries in this node? If so:
- **Invalidate**: Remove or update the old entry, note the correction
- **Reinforce**: No action needed, but mention it in confirmation

Update the living summary if this knowledge materially changes the current state of the node.

---

## Step 4 — Confirm

Brief confirmation:
```
Committed to [node-id]:
[TYPE]: [content]

[If applicable: "This updates/replaces a previous [TYPE] entry from [date]."]
```

---

## Behavior notes

- This is the fast path. No full extraction, no changelog entry, no continuity check.
- If the user isn't in a conversation with enough context to infer the node, ask.
- Multiple `/learn` calls in one session are fine — each writes independently.
- If the knowledge clearly spans multiple nodes, write to each.
